I've taken a bit of a detour laterly into learning about how to authenticate a console app with Google so that the app can access Google APIs. I figured others might want to build similar apps, so I decided to write up a small example of how you do it. Keep in mind that the following is up to date and relevant as of the time of writing, but as we all know things in the tech world are always subject to change.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, you'll want to make sure you have the following:

1. A Google account
2. A version of the dotnet SDK installed on your machine

## Configuring the Google Cloud Console



### Create a New Project



### Configure the OAuth Consent Screen



### Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials



## Setting Up the Console App


### Create Console App Configuration


### Build the Authentication URL


### Get the Authorization Code


### Get the Access Token


### Make a Request to a Google API


## Conclusion
