Recently I've been working to add a set of automated end-to-end smoke tests to cover reports within [Onspring](https://www.onspring.com/). Reports are a key feature of the platform and one of the key aspects of the reports is the ability to present the data within the reports in visually appealing and interesting ways using a variety of chart types. Initially I had taken the approach of building the reports and then asserting that particular aspects of the report were present in the DOM with the expected data. It worked, but then I remembered that [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) has a whole set of features for doing visual regression testing and I hadn't yet had a good opportunity to put them to use. This use case seemed like a perfect fit.
