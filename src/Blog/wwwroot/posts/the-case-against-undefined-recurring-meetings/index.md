It’s 10:00 AM on a Tuesday. Ten faces appear in a grid on your monitor. There is no crisis to solve. There is no decision to be made. There is no specific agenda other than the recurring calendar block labeled "Weekly Sync", "Team Meeting", or "Standup". You are not going to learn anything new. You are not going to contribute anything meaningful. You are not going to make any progress on your work. You are not going to have any fun.

For the next however long, you will listen to a round-robin of status updates that you could have read in an email. You will nod politely. You will check your phone. And you will lose the only currency that matters: your time.

We tend to view these meetings as "work." They feel like work. We are sitting at our desks, wearing professional attire, and discussing business. But the scientist in me can't help but think if we really analyzed the data it just might suggest that undefined recurring meetings (URMs) without a specific project or stated outcome—are not actually useful. They are really at their best a form of organizational procrastination and at their worst active stressors that burn capital, degrade cognitive momentum, and punish those of us who are trying to get real work done.

Here is my case for why most URMs suck.

## They are expensive

When someone schedules a meeting, they often view the cost in terms of the single unit of time that the meeting will take. But that is an accounting error. The true cost is the cumulative hourly rate of all the people in the room.

If you gather ten mid-to-senior-level employees, you aren't spending one hour; you are spending ten hours of the company's most expensive labor. I'm guessing this in reality across the entire economy is probably in the billions of dollars per year. Some figures I read online estimate it is roughly $25,000 per year per employee. Another interesting statistic claimed that senior employees spend close to 23 hours a week in meetings. The majority of which I'm guessing fall into this URM category.

It is funny too because most of us don't ever blink an eye at any of this practice. But if we were to work with a third-party who submitted an invoice for $25,000 with no evidence of any real services rendered we would be skeptical at best and probably just reject the invoice outright. But when it comes to meetings, we just accept it as the cost of doing business. I think we should be more critical of that.

## They are stressful

And from an individual contributor perspective, it isn't just all financial. These practices have real effects on our performance. We aren't designed for rapid context-switching that a calendar fragmented with meetings creates.

Deep work such as writing, coding, designing, analyzing data, or just generally thinking requires long uninterrupted blocks of time. These blocks offer the oppotunity to get into a "flow" state where you are fully immersed in the task at hand and can produce your best work. When that flow is interrupted or prevented from ever happening in the first place because you've got another 10:00 AM meeting, you are not just losing the meeting time. You are losing the time it takes to get into that flow state and the time it takes to recover from being pulled out of it. The estimates I've seen suggest this can be on average 20-30 minutes per interruption.

This also speaks to another documented phenomenon that is often referred to as Meeting Recovery Syndrome. I know it sounds made up, but it is a real thing. This is essentially describing the time spent cooling off or ruminating after a frustrating or ineffective meeting. It is characterized by mental fatigue and actual increases in cortisol levels. So again we aren't just paying a financial price for these meetings, we are also paying a real psychological and physiological price as well.

## They are unproductive

URMs are costly. We get it, but what if that cost turns into an investment because of how productive they are? I mean if we are learning new information, making important decisions, or collaborating on something that requires real-time communication, then maybe the cost is worth it. But they aren't. And it has far less to do with anything one individual is doing and much more with just how group dynamics work in a room full of people.

Without a clear outcome, groups naturally gravitate toward the easiest topics to discuss, not the most important. This is Parkinson's Law of Triviality at play. A team will breezily approve a $10 million project but spend 45 minutes debating the materials for a $500 bike shed. Why? Because a bike shed is something everyone can understand and have an opinion on. A $10 million project is complex and intimidating and most people will just defer to the experts or the leaders to make the decision. So in a URM, you are likely to spend most of your time discussing the least important topics because they are the ones that are easiest for everyone to engage with.

In addition, weird things happen to individual effort in group settings. It isn't necessarily because people are trying to slack off, but there is a diffusion of responsibility that occurs when you are in a group. There is this sub-conscious belief among participants that someone else will pick up the slack or that their individual contribution isn't as important because there are so many other people in the room. This is known as Social Loafing and it is a well-documented phenomenon in psychology. So even if you have a group of highly motivated and talented individuals, you might still end up with a group that is less productive than the sum of its parts because of this diffusion of responsibility.

And while I'm sure some will say well "that is why we hire good people and we have good leaders to make sure that doesn't happen." I would argue that even the best leaders and the best teams will still struggle with these dynamics in a URM setting. It is just the nature of how groups work. It is the exact opposite of what we should be doing. We should be trying to create environments that put people in the best position to succeed not trying their hardest not to fail.

## They are not strategic

The most commond defense of URMs is that they are necessary for team cohesion and communication. I mean have you even lived if you haven't listened to someone talk about the need for "alignment" amonst the team? I get it. I really do. But synchronous communication is the most expensive medium possible for status updates and it is far from the only medium for accomplishing them. In my opinion, in most cases it is not even the best way. 

I mean if one persion is talking and everyone else is listening, you are fundamentally trying to solve a data transfer problem, not a collaboration one and conversations are far from an efficient, effective, or scalable way to do that. Not to mention that round-robin updates just hold the entire room hostage to the speaking speed of the slowest person and the average adult reads must faster than the average adult speaks.

The cool thing is a lot of organizations are coming around to this idea. Shopify deleted something like 10,000+ recurring meetings from employee calendars. Basecamp has a company policy of no meetings. GitLab prioritizes asynchronous communication and has a lot of great resources on how to do that effectively. And there are a lot of other companies that are trying to be more intentional about how they use meetings and when they use them. So I think we are starting to see a shift in the culture around meetings and I hope that trend continues.

## They have an alternative

I hate being the guy who just points out the problem without offering a solution. So let me share my thoughts about what I think a good alternative is and what I've had success with in my own life when managing my own calendar and projects. First and foremost, we don't have to ban all meetings. Instead we just need to gatekeep them a bit more. And preferably you do it in a way that is easy for everyone to understand and implement. The easiest way I think to accomplish that is with a few simple questions that you can answer to figure out whether a meeting is worth having or not.

1. Why are we having this meeting?
2. What specific decision or deliverable will come out of this meeting?
3. How will the time allocated for the meeting actually be used?
4. Who needs to be there and why?
5. Who has the final say on the decision or deliverable that will come out of this meeting?

If you can't answer these questions, then you probably shouldn't be having the meeting. If you can answer them, then a meeting might be a good idea and you should have enough information to draft an agenda, invite the right people, and set expectations for how the time will be used. This also makes it much easier for people to decide whether they need to attend or not. In some cases you might provide enough context for people that the decision or deliverable can be made asynchronously without a meeting at all.

> Full disclosure: I'm not clever enough to come up with these myself. I can't remember exactly where I first encountered them. Maybe during my six sigma training? Or that time I went to an american management course? Or maybe I just read them in a book. But I think they are really helpful and I have found them to be a useful framework for thinking about meetings.

## Conclusion

I know in the grand scheme of things my complaints about URMs probably feel small. But I think we are trading our most valuable resource for the comfort of feeling or appearing busy. For the most part to me they feel like a relic of an era where physical presence was a proxy for productivity. I think we can and should try to do better.

Obviously I understand the realities of being and employee and working within a team. There is only so much you can do to change the culture of your organization. But I think we can all be more intentional about how we spend our time and how we ask others to spend their time. I hope this post gives you some ideas for how to do that.
