I wanted to build a Discord bot for my server. How hard could it be, right? Connect to Discord's API, listen for messages, respond when needed. Should be a weekend project.

Spoiler alert: it wasn't.

What I thought would be straightforward turned into a crash course in building resilient network clients. By the time I had a working `DiscordGatewayClient` that could stay connected reliably, I'd learned a bunch of things that made me a better developer.

Here's what building this bot taught meâ€”maybe some of it will be useful for your projects too.
